# References

Here is a list of references and code that I used to help build this app. This is primarily for places where I used code snippets, I am not including links that helped me answer small problems.

- This github repo is where I got the code for the [sudoku puzzle logic](https://github.com/JoeKarlsson/puthon-sudoku-generator-solver)
    - I stripped out everything except for the main sudoku.py file. I edited a few of the functions and added two additional functions to convert puzzles to strings and back
- This stackoverflow answer provided the css I used to [display puzzles](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19697033/styling-a-sudoku-grid)
